## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 99a6635: Added a new public API TSDoc quality gate (docs:api:check) that verifies callable exports from package entrypoints have TSDoc summaries.
  - Enforced that check in CI/docs workflows and documented it in contributor/docs guides.
  - Added the checker implementation and comprehensive tests for pass/fail/CLI behavior.
  - Added/updated TSDoc on key public exports:
    - core transition builders (tx, createTransitions)
    - react bindings factory (createJourneyBindings)
    - devtools bridge attach + protocol envelope/command validators
  - No runtime behavior changes; this branch is primarily API documentation quality/tooling hardening.
